# ch03: working with basic data types

>Everything in a computer is a sequence of binary digits. C's basic data types enable the compiler to tell the computer how to interpret binary sequences of data. ... A binary sequence plus a data type results in a meaningful value. ... This chapter will be the basis for the more complex data representations 

>## Understanding data types
>Everything in a computer is a sequence of binary digits (or bits). A single bit is either off (0) or on (1). Eight bits are strung together to form a byte. A byte is the basic unit of data. Bytes are treated singly, as pairs called 16-bit words, as quadruples to form 32-bit words, or as octets to form 64-bit words. These combinations of sizes of bytes are used in the following ways:
>
> - As instructions for the CPU
> - As addresses for the locations of all things in the computer
> - As data values

- 5 data types
  - whole numbers
  - decimal numbers
  - characters
  - booleans
  - addresses
